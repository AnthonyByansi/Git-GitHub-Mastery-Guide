## Using `git bisect` for Bug Hunting

When you're working on a software project, it's not uncommon to run into bugs. Sometimes these bugs are easy to fix, but other times they can be more elusive, and tracking them down can feel like searching for a needle in a haystack.

Luckily, Git provides a powerful tool that can help you track down bugs more efficiently: the `git bisect` command. With `git bisect`, you can easily pinpoint the commit where a bug was introduced, which can save you a lot of time and effort.

Here's how to use `git bisect` to track down a bug:

* Identify the last known good commit. This should be a commit where the bug wasn't present. You can use `git log` to browse through your commit history and find a commit that fits this criteria.
* Identify the first known bad commit. This should be a commit where the bug was present. If you're not sure when the bug was introduced, you can use `git bisect start` without any arguments to start bisecting from the current commit. Then you can use `git bisect bad` to mark the current commit as bad.
* Start bisecting. Use `git bisect start` to begin the bisecting process. Git will automatically select a commit between the last known good commit and the first known bad commit. It will then ask you to test that commit to see if the bug is present.
* Test the selected commit. Compile and run your codebase at the selected commit and determine whether the bug is present or not. If the bug is present, use `git bisect bad` to mark the commit as bad. If the bug is not present, use git bisect good to mark the commit as good.
* Repeat the process. Git will then select another commit between the last known good commit and the first known bad commit, and ask you to test it. Keep repeating this process until Git has narrowed down the commit where the bug was introduced.

* Identify the bug. Once Git has identified the commit where the bug was introduced, you can use git show <commit> to view the changes made in that commit. This can help you identify the specific code changes that introduced the bug.

* Fix the bug. Once you've identified the code changes that introduced the bug, you can work on fixing it. You can do this by making changes to your codebase and then using git bisect to test whether the bug is still present.
