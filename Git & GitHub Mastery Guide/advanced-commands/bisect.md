## Using `git bisect` for Bug Hunting

When you're working on a software project, it's not uncommon to run into bugs. Sometimes these bugs are easy to fix, but other times they can be more elusive, and tracking them down can feel like searching for a needle in a haystack.

Luckily, Git provides a powerful tool that can help you track down bugs more efficiently: the `git bisect` command. With `git bisect`, you can easily pinpoint the commit where a bug was introduced, which can save you a lot of time and effort.

Here's how to use `git bisect` to track down a bug:

* Identify the last known good commit. This should be a commit where the bug wasn't present. You can use `git log` to browse through your commit history and find a commit that fits this criteria.
* Identify the first known bad commit. This should be a commit where the bug was present. If you're not sure when the bug was introduced, you can use `git bisect start` without any arguments to start bisecting from the current commit. Then you can use `git bisect bad` to mark the current commit as bad.
* Start bisecting. Use git bisect start to begin the bisecting process. Git will automatically select a commit between the last known good commit and the first known bad commit. It will then ask you to test that commit to see if the bug is present.
