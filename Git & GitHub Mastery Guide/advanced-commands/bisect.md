## Using git bisect for Bug Hunting

When you're working on a software project, it's not uncommon to run into bugs. Sometimes these bugs are easy to fix, but other times they can be more elusive, and tracking them down can feel like searching for a needle in a haystack.

Luckily, Git provides a powerful tool that can help you track down bugs more efficiently: the `git bisect` command. With `git bisect`, you can easily pinpoint the commit where a bug was introduced, which can save you a lot of time and effort.
